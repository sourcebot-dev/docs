Sourcebot is an open-source code search tool ([Github](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot)). It allows teams to index repositories across various different platforms, and provides a powerful interface to search across them.

We have a [public demo](https://sourcebot.dev/search) if you'd like to try it out.

If you'd like to use Sourcebot with your own code, you can [self-host](/self-hosting) or get started for free on [Sourcebot Cloud](https://sourcebot.dev/login)
