In order to search your private repos, you'll need to provide Sourcebot with an access token. Access tokens are provided as [secrets](/docs/access-tokens/secrets), which are encrypted at rest and in transit using [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)

        Navigate to the [personal access token (PAT) creation page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) (or the equivelent page if you're
        self hosting)

        Ensure that the `repo` scope is enabled. This gives the PAT access to fetch your repos
