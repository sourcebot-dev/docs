Secrets are used to store sensitive data (ex. GitHub/GitLab access tokens), and can be referenced in [Connections](/connections/overview). The main use of secrets is to provide a connection with a personal access token to fetch private repositories.

### Create a secret

To create a secret, navigate to the `Secrets` page within `Settings`. Under `Import a new secret`, select the code host you're importing a secret for and follow the instructions presented.

### Referencing a secret

After creating a secret, it'll be available to reference within a [connection](/connections/overview). On the connection creation page, **press the secret selection drop down to reference your secret**. This will automatically add the secret reference to the 
configuration schema:
