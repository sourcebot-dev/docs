title: Getting started
---

<Note>This page assumes that you're either using Sourcebot Cloud or have spun up your own Sourcebot
self-hosted deployment. If you haven't, checkout out the [Overview](/overview) page.</Note>

This page will guide you through configuring Sourcebot with your teams repositories.

### Account Registration

When you visit a Sourcebot deployment for the first time (either Sourcebot Cloud or your own self-hosted deployment), you'll be presented with the following login page. Pick
your login method of choice to register for a new account.

<Note>Some login options may not be visible if you haven't configured them in your self-hosted deployment</Note>

### Organization Creation

After logging in, you'll be asked to create an organization. You'll invite your team members to this organization later so they can also use Sourcebot.

### Connection Creation

After creating an org, we jump right into creating a [connection](/connections/overview). Connections are how you tell Sourcebot which repositories you want to index.

<Note>If you're self-hosting Sourcebot, your source code never leaves your machine</Note>

#### Create Connection
After selecting a code host you want to connect to, you'll be presented with the connection creation page. This page has the following three inputs:
- Connection name (required): The name of the connection within Sourcebot
- Secret (optional): An [access token](/access-tokens/overview) that is used to fetch private repos
- Configuration: The JSON configuration schema that defines the repos/orgs to fetch. 

For a more detailed explenation of connections, check out the [Connections](/connections/overview) page.

The example below shows a connection named `sourcebot-org` that fetches all of the repos for the `sourcebot-dev` GitHub organization, but excludes the `sourcebot-dev/zoekt` repo

<Note>This page won't let you continue with an invalid connection schema. If you're hitting errors, make sure the input you're providing is a valid JSON</Note>

### Search

Once you create your organization's first connection successfully, you'll be redirected to your org's main search page. From here, you can use the search bar to search across all
of the repos you've indexed
