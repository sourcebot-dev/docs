Connections are how you tell Sourcebot what repositories you want to index. 

To index your code, you'll create a connection to your code host platform and tell Sourcebot which repos/users/orgs to fetch, as well as other information Sourcebot may need (ex. access tokens, instance URLs)

You can view your connections by navigating to...TODO
