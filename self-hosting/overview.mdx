Sourcebot is open source and can be self-hosted using our official Docker images. It's super easy to get started self-hosting Sourcebot, just run the following command:

``` bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --rm --name sourcebot ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:latest
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see your Sourcebot deployment in action. Check out our [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide to learn how to index your repos and use the tool.
